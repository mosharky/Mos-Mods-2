- If you want shaders, you'll have to install the [Oculus](https://modrinth.com/mod/oculus) mod. It could introduce a few visual bugs, even if you're not using shaders, so we opted to keep this mod out of the modpack and leave it as a choice
    - A fixed version of Complementary Shaders is already included in the modpack
- Toggle the inventory item search display by pressing CTRL + O. Your performance will increase in the inventory menu while its disabled.
- Press 0 in your numpad to configure the widget at the top of your screen that appears when you look at something.
- Disabling/Configuring certain features:
    - Custom mob animations: Disable the Fresh Animations resource packs
    - UI sounds: Esc > Mods > Sonance > Config
    - Environment sounds: Disable "Euphonium" mod or decrease "Ambient/Environment" sound volume
- Optional cosmetic mods (these weren't included for performance):
    - [Chunk Animator](https://modrinth.com/mod/chunkanimator) - Chunk loading animations
    - [Falling Leaves](https://modrinth.com/mod/fallingleavesforge) - Leaf particles under trees
    - [Oculus](https://modrinth.com/mod/oculus) - Shaders
    - [InvMove](https://modrinth.com/mod/invmove) - Move around while in inventory
