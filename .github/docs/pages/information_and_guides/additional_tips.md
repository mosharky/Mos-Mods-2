- If you want shaders, you'll have to install the [Oculus](https://modrinth.com/mod/oculus) mod. It could introduce a few visual bugs, even if you're not using shaders, so we opted to keep this mod out of the modpack and leave it as a choice
    - A fixed version of Complementary Shaders is already included in the modpack
- Optional cosmetic mods (these weren't included for performance):
    - [Chunk Animator](https://modrinth.com/mod/chunkanimator) - Chunk loading animations
    - [Falling Leaves](https://modrinth.com/mod/fallingleavesforge) - Leaf particles under trees
    - [Oculus](https://modrinth.com/mod/oculus) - Shaders
    - [InvMove](https://modrinth.com/mod/invmove) - Move around while in inventory
    - [ItemPhysic Lite](https://modrinth.com/mod/itemphysic-lite) and [CreativeCore](https://modrinth.com/mod/creativecore) - Realistic dropped item models
    - [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity) - Connected textures. Was not included in the modpack due to small visual bugs
