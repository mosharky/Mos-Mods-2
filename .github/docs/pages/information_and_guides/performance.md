## Allocating more ram
The modpack by default uses and at-minimum needs 4000MB or 4GB of memory allocated. If you have **more** than 8GB of ram, consider allocating 6-8GB!

1. Select the instance in Prism Launcher
2. On the right, select **"Edit"**
3. On the left, select **"Settings"**
4. Ensure that **"Memory"** is checked
5. Change the minimum and maximum memory allocations
    - 4096MB is required at-minimum
    - 4200MB is the maximum that can be allocated if you have 8GB of ram without crushing your computer
        - If your system runs on Windows 10 or lower, you might be able to allocate 5000MB
    - 8192MB of memory is recommended if your system has 16GB or more
        - Do not go higher than 8500MB. You'll lose performance.

## Increasing FPS
- **DO NOT PLAY ON WINDOWED MODE**
- Press `O` to disable the pokemon menu; you'll gain a considerable amount of FPS
- For more inventory FPS, press `CTRL + O` to disable the item search panel
- Change some video settings (Esc > Video Settings):
    - General:

    - Quality:
        - Set "Graphics" to Fast

        - Disable "Smooth Lighting"
        - Disable "Entity Shadows"
        - Set "Mipmap Levels" to 0 (the game will reload all textures after changing this)
    - Extras:
        - Disable "Enable Fog"
        - Enable "Enable Max Entity Distance"
- Besides changing in-game settings, you could try to add some more performance mods:
