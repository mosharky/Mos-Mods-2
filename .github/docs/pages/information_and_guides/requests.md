# Requests
If you want a guideline on how to request an addition to the modpack, this is the page for it!

## Mod Request
I won't always accept mod requests. I'm stubborn and picky, but I have my reasons, which of course I'd outline to you in the event that I refuse!

<u><b>Please provide:</u></b>

- A description of the type of mod you'd like to see (ex: "I want a furniture mod that does [......]")
- or a link to the specific mod (preferably to [modrinth.com](https://modrinth.com/))


***


## Origin Request
I can make you a custom origin, but not *everything* is going to be possible. There are limits, but they aren't many. Shoot your request and I'll let you know if its possible.

- Design your origin within reason; don't make it too powerful. I will try to let you know if it's maybe too weak or too powerful.
- Consider my time. Don't expect your origin to come soon if it's complex.

<u><b>Please provide:</u></b>

- Origin name
- Origin description
- Origin difficulty (optional)
    - Easy, medium, or hard.
    - This is just a visual indicator in the origin selection screen. The actual difficulty depends on the design of course.
- Origin icon
    - This can be an existing item in the modpack or a custom texture `.png` file, and preferably with size `16x16` or `32x32`. Do not go any higher than 64x64.
- Ability names
- Ability descriptions
    - Avoid grammatical or spelling errors please :)
    - This description is what will be seen in-game. If the ability needs a more technical description for me to implement it properly, then just send both.

**If the ability needs a cooldown or resource bar, please select a bar from one of these images to visually represent it:**

- [`resource_bar`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apace100/origins-fabric/1.20/src/main/resources/assets/origins/textures/gui/resource_bar.png)
- [`huang/resource_bar_01`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apace100/origins-fabric/1.20/src/main/resources/assets/origins/textures/gui/community/huang/resource_bar_01.png)
- [`huang/resource_bar_02`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apace100/origins-fabric/1.20/src/main/resources/assets/origins/textures/gui/community/huang/resource_bar_02.png)
- [`spiderkolo/resource_bar_01`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apace100/origins-fabric/1.20/src/main/resources/assets/origins/textures/gui/community/spiderkolo/resource_bar_01.png)

- [`spiderkolo/resource_bar_03`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apace100/origins-fabric/1.20/src/main/resources/assets/origins/textures/gui/community/spiderkolo/resource_bar_03.png)
- [`spiderkolo/resource_bar_points_01`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apace100/origins-fabric/1.20/src/main/resources/assets/origins/textures/gui/community/spiderkolo/resource_bar_points_01.png)
- You could make your own. [Here's our resource bars](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mosharky/Mos-Mods-2/main/kubejs/assets/kubejs/textures/gui/resource_bar.png); just save the image, replace one of the grayed-out bars and its icon, and send me the image.
- I could make one for you as well! It will take me longer to finish your origin though, of course

## Music Disc Request
Provide:

- The song in `.ogg` file format
- The author and name of the song
- The disc centre colour(s) (or send me a custom `.png` image, preferably with size `16x16`).

## Other
If the guidelines aren't written here, just send me a message asking for it or something. Don't question the limits, just ask and I'll try to make it happen.
