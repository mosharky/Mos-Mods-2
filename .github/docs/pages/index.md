# Welcome to the Mo's Mods 2 SMP!

This modpack was designed for a long-term multiplayer survival world, so we've skipped on some mods that could fast-track progress and added mods that encourage building. For example, we've skipped on adding the Waystones mod as to encourage everyone to either build closer or to build paths/rails/trains to eachother.

!!! info
    - Minecraft version 1.20.1 for Forge
    - Server IP is `mosmods2.cloudnord.net`
    - ~260 mods (many of which are library/API mods that don't add anything)
      - You can find the modlist [here](https://mosharky.github.io/Mos-Mods-2/information_and_guides/modlist/)
    - The modpack auto-updates every time you launch it
    - The backpack keybind is `B`, and it's not configurable due to a bug
    - We plan to connect eachother with trains eventually
    - Feel free to DM me (**@.mo_mo**) if you have any issues or would like to make a suggestion (please don't feel bad if I reject. I'm picky)

!!! warning
    - **Playing in windowed mode will cause stutters and FPS drops**
    - Entering your inventory for the first time in the session will cause a momentary stutter
